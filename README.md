# Traffic Light Controller Project [1.0]

In this project we will be building a traffic light system using an Arduino. With the use of an infrared sensor, the traffic light will change with the presence of a toy car which will be moving with the help of a magnet.

# Requirements and Materials

* 1 x Arduino (Any Arduino works)
* 1 x breadboard
* 1 x Infrared sensor
* 1 x Magnet
* 2 x Toy cars (Hot-wheels type)
* 1 x 10k ohm resistor
* 6 x 220 ohm resistor
* 1 x push button switch
* 1 x red LED
* 1 x yellow LED
* 1 x green LED
* Jumper cables
