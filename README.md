# Traffic Light Controller Project [2.0]

In this project we will be building a traffic light system using an Arduino. With the use of an infrared sensor, the traffic light will change with the presence of a toy car which will be moving with the help of a magnet.

# Requirements and Materials

* 1 x Arduino (Any Arduino works)
* 1 x Laser pointer
* 1 x Photoresistor
* 1 x Magnet
* 2 x Toy cars (Hot-wheels type)
* 6 x 220 ohm resistor
* 2 x red LED
* 2 x RGB LED
* 2 x green LED
* Jumper cables


# Build Instructions

Describe build, add picture.

# Usage

The project consists in a traffic light intersection powered by an Arduino Uno which changes with the help of a laser and a photoresistor. The photoresistor measures the amount of light in its surroundings; furthermore, if the laser is pointing to the photoresistor all the time and the laser gets blocked by a toy car, in this case, the light measurement will fluctuate resulting in changing the traffic lights from red to green.
